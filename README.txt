The Intel速 SgxSSL cryptographic library is intended to provide cryptographic services for Intel速 Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclave applications.
The Intel速 SgxSSL cryptographic library is based on the underlying OpenSSL* Open Source project, providing a full-strength 
general purpose cryptography library.
The API exposed by the Intel速 SgxSSL library is fully compliant with unmodified OpenSSL APIs.

In order to build an SGXSSL package, follow the below steps:
	1. Download OpenSSL package into openssl_source/ directory. (tar.gz package, e.g. openssl-1.1.0e.tar.gz)
	2. Update version number in build script build_sgxssl.sh. (OPENSSL_VERSION=)
	3. Run buildsgxssl.sh.

This will create the SGXSSL libraries (libsgx_tsgxssl_crypto.a, libsgx_tsgxssl.a, libsgx_usgxssl.a), which can be found in package/lib64/{debug|release}/.
